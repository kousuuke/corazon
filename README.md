# crzn. â€” The Silent Shortener

**crzn.** is a URL shortener website inspired by ***Donquixote Rosinante***, also known as ***Corazon***, from the beloved anime series One Piece. Just as Corazon's Nagi Nagi no Mi (Calm-Calm Fruit) creates areas of silence, our shortener aims to silence the noise of long, cumbersome URLs, turning them into short, elegant links that provide a moment of tranquility in the vastness of the internet.

We believe that sharing information should be as smooth and unobtrusive as Corazon's silent steps.
